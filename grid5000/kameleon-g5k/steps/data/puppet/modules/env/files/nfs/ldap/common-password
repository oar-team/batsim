# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.

# Explanation of pam_unix options:
#
# The "nullok" option allows users to change an empty password, else
# empty passwords are treated as locked accounts.
#
# The "md5" option enables MD5 passwords.  Without this option, the
# default is Unix crypt.
#
# The "obscure" option replaces the old `OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB' option in
# login.defs.
#
# You can also use the "min" option to enforce the length of the new
# password.
#
# See the pam_unix manpage for other options.

password sufficient      pam_ldap.so
password   required   pam_unix.so nullok obscure md5

# Alternate strength checking for password. Note that this
# requires the libpam-cracklib package to be installed.
# You will need to comment out the password line above and
# uncomment the next two in order to use this.
# (Replaces the `OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB', `CRACKLIB_DICTPATH')
