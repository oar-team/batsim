    ,SCHED_CREATE_PROBE       //!< Scheduler -> Server. The scheduler tells the server a scheduling event occured (create a new probe).
    ,SCHED_STOP_PROBE         //!< Scheduler -> Server. The scheduler tells the server a scheduling event occured (stop a probe).

    ,SCHED_PROFILE_REGISTERED //!< Scheduler -> Server. The scheduler tells the server that the decision process wants to register a profile
    ,SCHED_END_DYNAMIC_REGISTRATION //!< Scheduler -> Server. The scheduler tells the server that dynamic job submissions are finished.
    ,SCHED_PSTATE_MODIFICATION      //!< Scheduler -> Server. The scheduler tells the server a scheduling event occured (modify the state of some resources).

    ,ONESHOT_REQUESTED_CALL //!< OneShot -> Server. The target time of a OneShot requested call has been reached.
    ,PERIODIC_TRIGGER       //!< Periodic -> Server. The target time of periodic events has been reached, which has has triggered events.
