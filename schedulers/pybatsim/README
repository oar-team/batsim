PyBatsim
========

PyBatsim helps you developping your own scheduler in python!


launcher.py         -> This is the main entry point to launch things
                       Ex: python launcher.py filler_sched ../../workload_profiles/test_workload_profile.json (a server should be started)

launch_expe.py      -> Provide an easy way to launch a complete simulation.
                       Just provide a file that looks like sample.expe.json to this script and it will launch batsim and the scheduler with the right options.

sample.expe.json    -> See launch_expe.json

batsim/
    batsim.py       -> this class helps you communicate with the batsim server

schedulers/         -> contains all the schedulers
                       Schedulers name should follow this convention:
                       foo_bar.py contains the FooBar classname which has as an ancestor BatsimScheduler
    filler_sched.py -> A kind of first fit without topology scheduler
    easy_backfill   -> EASY backfilling where jobs are seen as rectangles
