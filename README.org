* Batsim

Batsim is a Batch Scheduler Simulator. A Batch scheduler AKA Resources and jobs management system (RJMS) is a syteme that manage large scale cluster job placement and scheduling and computation nodes energy policies.

This simulator is made to plug any event based scheduler algorithm to a simulated distributed platform managed by a simulated RJMS. Thus, it permit to compare decission algorithms comming from production and academics worlds.

** Installation

*** Dependencies
 - SimGrid revision f620ec2586f1596d7 on git://scm.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/simgrid.git
 - rapidjson
 - boost (system, filesystem)
 - C++11 compiler

*** First step: generate Makefile via CMake
: mkdir build
: cd build
: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

*** Second step: make
: make

** Usages
*** Common part for cases (without energy):
In a terminal:
: ./build/batsim platforms/small_platform.xml workload_profiles/test_workload_profile.json

**** With fake scheduler
In a second terminal:
: python fake_sched_uds.py workload_profiles/test_workload_profile.json

**** With filler scheduler
: python filler_sched.py workload_profiles/test_workload_profile.json

*** Energy experiments
**** Batsim
: ./build/batsim -p platforms/energy_platform_homogeneous.xml workload_profiles/test_workload_profile.json
**** Scheduler
: python fcfs_sleeper_sched.py workload_profiles/test_workload_profile.json

**** With oar core scheduler
In a second terminal:

- First install the required oar-3 libraries.

 : git clone https://github.com/oar-team/oar3.git
 : cd oar3
 : sudo python setup.py install

- Second use *bataar.py* which is the adaptor for OAR3 to interact with BatSim.
 : cd oar/kao
 : ./baatar.py ../../batsim/workload_profiles/test_workload_profile.json

Refer to [[https://github.com/oar-team/oar3][oar3]] site or bataar.py -h for more to information.

** Write your own scheduler (or adapt an existing one)

As Batsim is using a text-based protocol your scheduler have to implement this protocole: For more detail on the protocole, see [[./doc/proto_description.md][protocol description]].

A good starting point is Pybatsim which helps you to easily implement your scheduling policy in Python. See [[./schedulers/pybatsim/][pybatsim folder]] for more details.

** Display information control
 Batsim has its own set of options but it can also handle standard SimGrid ones.
 The end-of-options delimiter "--" must then be used to use SimGrid options.

*** Display Batsim options/help
 ./batsim PLATFORM WORKLOAD --help

*** Display SimGrid options/help
 ./batsim PLATFORM WORKLOAD -- --help

*** Quiet run
 ./batsim [batsim_options...] PLATFORM WORKLOAD -q

*** Display network information only
 ./batsim [batsim_options...] PLATFORM WORKLOAD -vnetwork-only

*** Display debug information
 ./batsim [batsim_options...] PLATFORM WORKLOAD -vdebug

*** Generate SimGrid processes' trace (can be useful to visualize what happens)
 ./batsim [batsim_options...] PLATFORM WORKLOAD -t
